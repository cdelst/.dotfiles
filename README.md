# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and configurations for various tools and applications. It is also a definition of all the tools I use and am comfortable with.  

There are some tools that are not configured via text file.  For example: 
1. IntelliJ IDEA. Configured via account sync.  use `casedelst@gmail.com`
2. VSCode / Cursor.  Configured via account sync.  use `casedelst@gmail.com`
3. Obsidian.  Configured via account sync.  use `casedelst@gmail.com`


To Install, clone the repo and run `./install`.  This will use dotbot to install all the tools and configurations.  You will need to have `git` and `curl` installed.  You will also need to have `zsh` as your shell.  If you are using a mac, you can use `brew` to install these tools.
