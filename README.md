# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and configurations for various tools and applications. It is also a definition of all the tools I use and am comfortable with.  

There are some tools that are not configured via text file.  For example: 
1. IntelliJ IDEA. Configured via account sync.  use `casedelst@gmail.com`
2. VSCode / Cursor.  Configured via account sync.  use `casedelst@gmail.com`
3. Obsidian.  Configured via account sync.  use `casedelst@gmail.com`
